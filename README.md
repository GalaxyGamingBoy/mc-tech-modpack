# MC Tech Modpack w/ Quilt
This modpack was created a while ago but the PackWiz files were passed privately between the members.  
So, I exported them again and this time uploaded them to Github for all to see! :D  
Expect it to be updated, _hopefully_

## Play
To play it just load the `modpack.mrpack` file that is found on the release folder.  
You can download it [here](https://github.com/GalaxyGamingBoy/mc-tech-modpack/releases/latest/download/modpack.mrpack).  
On MultiMC/PrismLauncher there should be an import instance option, just enter the following link: `https://github.com/GalaxyGamingBoy/mc-tech-modpack/releases/latest/download/modpack.mrpack`
